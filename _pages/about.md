I am a fourth-year PhD candidate in Empirical Legal Studies and Data Protection Law at <a href="https://www.eur.nl/en/esl">Erasmus School of Law</a>. My research explores the extent to which EU data protection law is able to curb the platform power of mobile platforms, with a special focus on the role of app stores and mobile operating systems. In my research, I am combining both doctrinal (legal) methods with empirical insights - to see an example, check out my <a href="https://policyreview.info/articles/analysis/death-privacy-policies-how-app-stores-shape-gdpr-compliance-apps">latest publication</a>.

  In January and February 2025 I was a Visiting Research Fellow at  <a href="https://www.weizenbaum-institut.de/">Weizenbaum Institut</a>.Before starting my PhD, I gained experience in platform regulation through internships at the <a href="https://www.monopolkommission.de/en/">Monopolies Commission</a> and the <a href="https://www.bundeskartellamt.de/EN/Home/home_node.html">Bundeskartellamt</a> (German Competition Authority). Additionally, I developed skills in empirical methods and programming during my time as a research assistant at the <a href="https://www.zew.de/en">ZEW</a> (Leibniz Centre for European Economic Research).
