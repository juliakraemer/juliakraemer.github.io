  abstract = {Mobile tracking poses significant risks to user privacy. Mobile advertising identifiers and Software Development Kits (SDKs) play a central role in this process, which is largely determined by the governance of mobile app stores and operating systems - both dominated by Apple and Google. Recently, both companies have made headlines for incorporating Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs) into their products that impact mobile tracking. While these initiatives represent a step toward addressing the issue of tracking, they have also faced criticism for raising competition law concerns as they ultimately do not apply to their native services. Their actual impact on compliance with data protection laws, however, has not yet been sufficiently assessed. This article examines the extent to which these PETs comply with the principles of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). This article argues that most of the PETs introduced by Apple and Google are 'soft PETs', ie they focus on transparency and leave critical data flows, including those supporting their native tracking ecosystems, largely untouched.}

  abstract = {We study how asymmetric enforceability of regulation affects firms' compliance by leveraging the introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation and its transparency principle. The principle compels firms to disclose, in accessible language, details of their data collection. The disclosure requirements are objective, whereas the required readability is subjective and difficult to enforce. We document that firms increased disclosure in their privacy policies without improving readability. Firms facing better-funded data regulators and those anticipating higher scrutiny demonstrated a stronger response in readability compliance (neglected otherwise) without sizeable disclosure effects, suggesting a strategic response to the degree and asymmetry of enforcement.}

  abstract = {The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) obliges data controllers to inform users about data processing practices. Long criticised for inefficiency, privacy policies face a substantive shift with the recent introduction of privacy labels by the Apple App Store and the Google Play Store. This paper illustrates how privacy disclosures of apps are governed by both the GDPR and the contractual obligations of app stores and is complemented by empirical insights into the privacy disclosures of 845,375 apps from the Apple App Store and 1,657,353 apps from the Google Play Store. While the GDPR allows for the use of privacy labels as a complementary tool next to privacy policies, the design of the privacy labels does not satisfy the standards set in Art. 5(1)(a) GDPR and Art. 12-14 GDPR. The app stores may consequently distort the compliance of apps with data protection laws. The empirical data highlight further problems with the privacy labels. The design of the labels favours disclosures of developers that offer a variety of apps that can process data across different services and contradictory disclosures do not get flagged nor verified by app stores. The paper contributes to the overall discussion of how app stores in their role as intermediaries govern privacy standards and the impact of private sector-led initiatives.}

  year={2024},
  institution={National Bureau of Economic Research},
  journal = {NBER Working Paper},
  doi = {10.3386/w32913},
  abstract ={This chapter explores the interaction between the enforcement of and compliance with difficult-to-enforce rules in the context of data regulation. We focus on the effect of the introduction of the GDPR and its transparency principle on the readability of privacy policies for a large sample of German firms. Germany has a system of state-level data protection authorities. These data regulators enforce the same rules but face diverse funding situations, allowing for an ideal setting to study the role of a regulator's capacity in firms' compliance decisions. We find that while, on average, the GDPR lead to less readable policies, firms active in industries that have in the past received more regulatory scrutiny and those active in jurisdictions of better-funded data regulators exhibit a stronger compliance with the GDPR's readability requirement. These results exemplify a more general interaction between regulators' enforcement activity and firms' regulatory compliance. }

concepts and provisions from Chapters II and III of the Regulation. The
chapter has two main objectives: first, to bridge the gap between empirical
and doctrinal research by explaining fundamental GDPR provisions to
non-legal audiences; and second, to examine the extent to which these
provisions have been explored through empirical research. This includes
identifying common methods used, revealing that, only six years after
the Regulation’s implementation, a rich body of empirical research has
emerged to evaluate its effectiveness. The chapter concludes with a discussion of the challenges social scientists face when empirically investigating
the impact of the GDPR, such as translating empirical findings into legal
conclusions.}
